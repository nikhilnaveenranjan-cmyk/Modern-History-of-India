                explanation: "The Indigo Revolt (1859-60) took place in Bengal immediately after the revolt of 1857. Sanyasi Rebellion occurred in 1763-1800, Santhal Rebellion occurred in 1855-56, and Pabna uprising took place in 1873-76. Indigo Revolt began in Govindpur village of Nadia district in West Bengal led by two former employees of indigo producers. Digambar Viswas and Vishnu Viswas organized the peasants into a counterforce and refused to sow indigo. This indigo revolt of Bengal was directed against British planters who forced peasants to take advances and sign fraudulent contracts which forced the peasants to grow Indigo under terms that were least profitable to them. In September, 1859 all the cultivators revolted against the landlords. The agitation spread to regions like Nadia, Pabana, Khulna, Dhaka, Malda, Dinajpur, etc. All indigo factories were shut down due to this strike. The intellectual class of Bengal expressed support for the Movement through their articles and rallies. The editor of \"Hindu Patriot\" Harishchandra Mukherjee played a significant role in this agitation. This revolt was vividly portrayed by Dinbandhu Mitra in his play Neel Darpan."

The movement was led by Syed Ahmed Barelavi, who was greatly influenced by the teachings of Abdul Wahab of Arabia and Shah Walliulah, the saint of Delhi. It was a revivalist movement that stated that the return to the true spirit of Islam was the only way to get rid of the socio-political oppression. Through the efforts of Syed Ahmad, Wahabi ideology was spread in Kabul, North-West Frontier Province, Bengal, Bihar and Central Provincial regions. In 1830 Syed occupied Peshawar and sometimes issued coins bearing his name but later in the following year Syed Ahmed lost his life in the Battle of Balakot. Patna became the centre of the Wahabi Movement after the death of Syed Ahmad."

Traditionally, the Mundas enjoyed the system known as Khuntkatti which meant the original clearing of the forest. However, in the course of time, the Mundas realized that this system was being corroded by the jaghirdars and thikedars who came as moneylenders and traders. In the year 1895, Birsa declared himself prophet. This movement was popularly known as Sardari Idai. Munda was arrested in 1900 and later died in jail."
