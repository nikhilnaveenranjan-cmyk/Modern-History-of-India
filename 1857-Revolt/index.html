Army Commanders refused rumours without any cross-checking, but the soldiers were of the view that this was an intentional act of the British to besmirch their religion. This became the immediate cause first Independence Struggle of India in 1857.`

The sepoys, a generic term used for native Indian soldiers of the Bengal Army, had their own list of grievances against the British East India Company administration. The spark that led to the mutiny was the issue of new gunpowder cartridges for Enfield rifle in January 1857. There was a widespread belief that the cartridges contained cow or pig fat. This insulted both the Hindu and Muslim religious practices. Underlying grievances like taxation and land annexations by East India company were ignited by the sepoy mutineers, and within weeks dozens of units of Indian army joined the peasant army in widespread rebellion. The old aristocracy, both Muslim and Hindu, who were seeing their power being steadily eroded by the East India company also rebelled against British rule.`

                explanation: `The inefficiency of the officers was not a cause for the Sepoy Mutiny. The Indian Rebellion of 1857 occurred as a result of an accumulation of factors over time, rather than any single event, like an effort by officers to spread Christianity among the soldiers led to interference in the religious matters of the people. The order of the Company to the sepoys to travel on a ship was another reason as in Hinduism it was believed that travelling by sea could deprive them of their religious status of being a Hindu. A more immediate cause of the sepoy’s dissatisfaction was the recent order that they would not be given the foreign service allowance (Bhatta/Batta) when serving in Sindh or Punjab and rumours of the use of animal fat in the cartridges of the New Enfield Rifle.`

                explanation: `The first expression of organized resistance was the Revolt of 1857. It began as a revolt of the Sepoys of the Company’s army but eventually secured the participation of the masses. The Meerut Mutiny marked the beginning of the Revolt of 1857. The Indian sepoys in Meerut murdered their British officers and broke the jail. On May 10, they marched to Delhi. In Delhi, the mutineers were joined by the Delhi sepoys, and the city came under their control. Next day, on 11th May, the sepoys proclaimed Bahadur Shah Zafar as the Emperor of Hindustan. But Bahadur Shah was old, and he could not give able leadership to the sepoys. The occupation of Delhi was short-lived. In May 1857 the Battle of Shamli took place between the forces of Hazi Imdadullah and the British. The Sikhs and Pathans of the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province supported the British and helped to recapture Delhi on 20th September, 1857.`

Kunwar Singh was born in Jagdishpur in Shahabad (now in Bhojpur District) of Bihar. He belonged to Arrah in Bihar during the mutiny. When the people of all parts of India rose against British authority in 1857, Babu Kunwar Singh was nearly eighty years old. At that age, he fought against the English East India Company. Despite his age and failing health, Kunwar Singh plunged into the thick of it and battled against the British forces with grim determination and undaunted courage. In Bihar, Kunwar Singh was the Leader against the British. He assumed command of the soldiers who had revolted at Danapur on 25th July 1857. Two days later he occupied Arrah, the district headquarters. Major Vincent Eyre relieved the town in August 1857, defeated Kunwar Singh’s force and destroyed Jagdishpur. Kunwar Singh left his ancestral village and reached Lucknow in December 1857. In March 1858, he occupied Azamgarh. However, he had to leave the place soon. He was pursued by Brigadier Douglas, and he retreated towards his home in Bihar. On 23 April 1858, Kunwar Singh had a victory near Jagdishpur over the force led by Captain Le Grand, but on 26 April 1858, he died in his village. The mantle of the old chief now fell on his brother Amar Singh who, despite heavy odds, continued the struggle and for a considerable time ran a parallel government in the then district of Shahabad. In October 1859 Amar Singh joined the rebel leaders in the Nepal Terai.`
